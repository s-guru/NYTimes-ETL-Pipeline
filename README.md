# NYTimes-ETL-Pipeline

This is a final project made for the Rutgers Object Oriented Programming class.

The purpose of the project was to build an ETL pipeline to the New York Times API to retreieve data from it.
This program retrieves two sets of datasets regarding environmental issues; the article count during the presidentcy of Obama and the other of Trump.

It will retrieve all the data, transform it into a human readable form while cleaning it, and then load them into csv files which can be used for further analysis.
